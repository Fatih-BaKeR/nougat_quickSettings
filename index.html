            <h3>How can I use the app?</h3>
          </a>
          <p>In the first place, you need to ensure your device is properly supported 
            (check out <a href="#supported-devices">"Is the app supported on my device?"</a>).
          </p>
          <p>Then, open the app and click on a category you may be interested in.
            Find a feature (or "tile") you want to enable, click on it and select <b>"Enable tile".</b>
          </p>
          <p>Finally, follow <a href="#after-enabling-features">"Where can I find the features I've enabled?"</a></p>

            <h3>Is the app supported on my device?</h3>
          </a>
          <p>The app requires at least Android 7.0 to work.</p>
          <p>It may not work on some unpopular brands, but it's worth to give a try.
            In case your smartphone or its brand is quite popular, 99% of the cases,
            the app works just fine.
          </p>
          <p>If you're still having issues on a device of a popular brand, 
            see <a href="#tiles-not-responding">"When I click on the tiles they don't respond."</a>
          </p>

            <h3>Where can I find the features I've enabled?</h3>
          </a>
          <p>I understand this is the most difficult part of the app to understand, trust me.</p>
          <p>Scroll down the notification panel twice, until it's fully expanded. Then, you may find a pencil icon or an "Edit" button (try scrolling horizontally or opening menus). Once you've found any of these, click it.</p>
          <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=1eC2FUBxqWfv7-wBZv2aD9uNk5AY7cEY0">Here you can find some examples of those icons you need to click.</a></p>
          <p>Scroll down to the bottom: here you should see all the features you've enabled. Drag and drop them at the top of the screen, then close this menu.</p>
          <p>All done, you're ready to go! Enjoy the app.</p>

            <h3>When I click on the tiles, they don't respond</h3>
          </a>
          <p>This is an issue which occurs on some brand's smartphones.</p>
          <p>Go to <a href="https://dontkillmyapp.com/">dontkillmyapp.com</a> and click on the name of the brand of your smartphone. Finally, follow the steps under <b>"Solution for users"</b>.</p>
          <p>In case the issue is still there, please send me an email.</p>

            <h3>How can I use the tiles in the "System secure" category?</h3>

          <p>You need to use a tool on your computer. Detailed instructions are available at <a href="/qs-enabler.html">this page (QS Enabler)</a></p>

            <h3>How can I use the tiles which require root permission?</h3>
          </a>
          <p>Since you're looking at that message, it looks like you haven't root permission on your phone.</p>
          <p>Don't you know what root permission is? Read <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/root-android-277350/">this page on Android Authority</a>, it explains everything in detail. Anyway, in case you decide to go ahead and root your device, <u>I'm not responsible for anything that may happen.</u></p>
          <p>In case you're actually using a rooted device, disable any system which hides root or send me an email.</p>
